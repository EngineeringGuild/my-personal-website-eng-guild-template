## üìà Project Management & Workflow

We use a modern, transparent workflow inspired by PMI and Agile best practices:

- **All work is tracked via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Caioasc/my-personal-website/issues) and [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/Caioasc/my-personal-website/projects).**
- **Milestones** are used for major releases and phases.
- **Kanban board** visualizes progress (To Do, In Progress, Review, Done).
- **Labels** categorize tasks by type and priority.
- **Every change is linked to an issue and a pull request.**

For high-level planning, see [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md).
For process improvements, see [docs/RETROS.md](docs/RETROS.md).
For all documentation, see [docs/README.md](docs/README.md).

> **How to contribute:**
> 1. Open an issue for any new feature, bug, or improvement.
> 2. Assign yourself or discuss with the team.
> 3. Create a branch, reference the issue in your PR, and follow the contribution guidelines.

## üöÄ Deployment & Release Process

This project uses **semantic-release** for all versioning and release automation. Manual versioning or releases are deprecated and should not be used.

### Automated Release Workflow
- Every push to `main` triggers the semantic-release workflow.
- The workflow analyzes commit messages, determines the next version, updates `package.json` and `CHANGELOG.md`, creates a GitHub release, and pushes changes back to the repository.
- **Do not manually edit the version in `package.json` or create releases/tags.**
- The legacy manual release workflow is deprecated and should not be used for production releases.

See `.github/workflows/semantic-release.yml` and `.releaserc.json` for configuration details.

## üöÄ Deployment

This project is configured for deployment on Hostinger using MCP (Model Context Protocol) for automation.

- Automated with GitHub Actions and Hostinger MCP.
- See `.github/workflows/` for CI/CD details.

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

### Deployment Commands

The project uses Hostinger MCP for automated deployment. See deployment documentation for details.

## üèóÔ∏è Template Usage & Customization (Engineering Guild)

This project is designed as a template for Engineering Guild members. You can fork or use this template to create your own personal site and management platform. To keep your site up-to-date with the latest improvements, follow the template workflow:

- **Fork or use as a template** to create your own repository.
- **Set up the upstream remote** to receive updates from the official template.
- **Sync updates regularly** to benefit from new features and bug fixes.
- **Customize safely** by placing your changes in a dedicated `custom/` folder or using config files, avoiding direct edits to core template files.
- **See [docs/TEMPLATE_WORKFLOW.md](docs/TEMPLATE_WORKFLOW.md) for full instructions, best practices, and troubleshooting.**

### Recommended Folder Structure for Customization

```text
prototype/
  custom/           # Your custom components, pages, configs
  components/       # Core template components (do not edit directly)
  pages/            # Core template pages (extend, do not overwrite)
  ...
```
