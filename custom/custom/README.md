# Custom Folder for User Customizations

This folder is reserved for your personal customizations:
- Add your own components, pages, and configuration files here.
- Avoid editing core template files in `components/` or `pages/` directly.
- This approach helps you keep your customizations safe and makes it easier to sync updates from the main template.

For full instructions and best practices, see [../docs/TEMPLATE_WORKFLOW.md](../docs/TEMPLATE_WORKFLOW.md).
