# Custom Folder for User Customizations

This folder is reserved for your personal customizations:
- Add your own components, pages, and configuration files here.
- Avoid editing core template files in `components/` or `pages/` directly.
- This approach helps you keep your customizations safe and makes it easier to sync updates from the main template.

## Example: Custom Component

Create a file like `custom/MyCustomHeader.js` and import it in your pages or layout as needed.

## Example: Custom Config

Add a file like `custom/user.config.js` for your own settings, and import it where needed.
